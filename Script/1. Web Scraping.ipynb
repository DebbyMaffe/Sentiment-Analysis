    "The *class* ***Reviews*** provides methods to grab and extract reviews from an Amazon product page, store the scraped data  and save it to a JSON file for further analysis as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **__init__()** method is always executed when the class is invoked and it *initializes* the Reviews object with the Amazon Standard Identification Number (ASIN) of a given product. It sets the ASIN, creates an HTTP session object for making requests, defines headers for the requests, and constructs the URL for scraping the reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding the HTTP headers for requests, it is important to store and collect the ***User - Agent***, which is a short bit of text to describe the Software (or Browser) that is making the solicit to the e-commerce site; otherwise the request for extracting data may be blocked. Since I decide to inspect only the most recent data reviewed in the United Kingdom, I specify also the *language preference* ('en-US') weighted with the *quality value* ('q=0.5'). \n",
    "\n",
    "* The **pagination()** method takes a page number as input and constructs the *review URL* by appending the current page number, using the HTTP session object initialised in the previous step. Then, it sends an HTTP request to that URL and checks if there are reviews *available* on that page. If reviews are found, it returns the HTML elements corresponding to the reviews; otherwise, it returns False.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **get_reviews()** method requires a list of HTML elements representing *reviews* as input. It iterates over each review and extracts relevant information such as *title*, *rating*, *place and date*, and *body* text using CSS selectors, converting the content scraped into text format. It constructs a dictionary collecting all this information and appends it to a total list. Finally, it returns the list of dictionaries containing the review data. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, to scrape the review title:\n",
    "\n",
    "**title** = review.find('**a[data-hook = review-title]**', first = True).text\n",
    "\n",
    "meaning that we need to inspect the *'a'* tag, extract the desired value (*'review-title'*) corresponding to the class *'data-hook'*, and transform the content into text format. It is necessary to set *'first=True'* because request_html will always return a list. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The **save()** method stores the list of dictionaries containing review data, and *saves* it to a JSON file named 'ASIN_ID_reviews.json', where 'ASIN_ID' is the ASIN provided during object initialization. "

So glad I did. The kit is neatly packaged and comes with 3 sizes of ear piece. I have left the ones installed in as they seem to fit best. I find this one of the biggest pros in purchasing these earbuds. We are not a one size fits all and the fruit based manufacturer of over priced ear buds would do well to remember this. Second decent pro for me is the shape and fit. Nothing hanging down outside of your ear, and a really comfortable fit. Third pro (price vs sound quality). At this price you expect the sound to be average, which it is not. Good bass and level on the high end too. I tried varying types of music to get a a decent sample size and it was great across all genres. At this price you can’t go wrong. Fourth pro, they are easy to operate. The instructions that come with the product are clear and easy to follow, but as '}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Great performance, nice stable fit and superb value!', 'rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'place and date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 November 2019', 'body': 'I really like these earbuds - I would sum them up as great performance, nice stable fit and superb value.I had ordered and returned over 10 different earbud models from other vendors (some cheaper, some more expensive) before I found these T6s from Tozo and am finally satisfied.! I have used these with my laptop and my mobile, I have used them for work phone & video calls and been out for two runs using them, during one of which I got caught in the rain.The sound quality is great, good base (but not too heavy which I like) and colleagues reported they could hear me well through the mic with no difference compared to my traditional wired headset. Key for me was the comfort and stability of the fit. The main reason I sent back the others I tried was that they either hurt my ears after a time or would fall out while I exercised ran, however I had neither of these problems with the Tozo T6s. I found the smallest of the 4 sets of earbuds provided the best fit for me, with 4 to choose from I'}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars These are amazing', 'rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'place and date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 May 2022', 'body': 'I have been using these for months and can say they are amazing. I was surprised by the sound quality, they are extremely good for the price. The durability of these EarPods have surprised me too as they have been used whilst exercising and were being used on a daily. The charge lasts for a long time for my usage and I can say it lasted longer than other larger branded EarPods that I have used. It comes with different ear cushions that you can choose from and I haven’t had these EarPods falling out of my ears either.The Bluetooth connectivity is practically instant and I had no issues setting this up. I also had no issue changing from one ear to the other or going from one EarPods to both. The Bluetooth automatically adjusts once you have set up the connectivity which is all but a click of a button on your device. It is well worth the buy and I’d be surprised if you were disappointed by these since these have been perfect.'}, {'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars Life-Changing!!', 'rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'place and date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 July 2020', 'body': \"I confirm from the outset that I have only had these earphones for a day but OH MY GOODNESS I cannot believe I have not been using them all of this time!I was fed up of the wires of my earphones been tugged by my toddler and getting tangled up in my clothes/arms/everything(!!!) when I was out and about. I decided to try wireless earphones. I was overwhelmed by how many were on the market. I needed reliable, waterproof earphones which also had a mic and looked good. After much research I came across the T6's. I was very cautious about buying them because they were not manufactured by one of the big well known brands and were not reviewed on the various tech websites out there. I could not however ignore the overwhelmingly positive feedback they had on Amazon. So far, I have found the reviews to be accurate. These T6's look fantastic. They are super easy to set up. The sound quality is excellent. They are easy to operate. The charging case is adorable and small enough to transport around\"}]\n",
