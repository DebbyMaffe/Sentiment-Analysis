0,1 August 2023,United Kingdom,Second time buying these headphones as overall value for money,4,"I lost my first pair so I replaced them with the same because I really like the fit and sound quality. The case is cool with magnets to lock the earphones in place and it's easy to hold and find in my bag. I also love the pause/start touch on the surface of the headphones so you don't have to remove them to listen to something/someone.The only reason I've not rated the earphones 5 stars is that there's an occasional blip like the sound is not working in one earphone, but it corrects itself quickly and is not too annoying."
1,20 July 2023,United Kingdom,One Annoying Issue,4,"You get decent sound quality and comfort / functionality etc for the price, but my one main issue is that the charging case doesn't keep it's charge very well, and when it runs out of charge the buds will automatically start pairing with your devices. This means that every now and again I'll play something on my phone and the sound isn't working for some reason... Until I figure out that they're paired to my TOZOs in the other room! Seems like this could have been avoided in the design, but ah well. Just something to be aware of."
2,7 July 2023,United Kingdom,üëçüëç,4,I have a pair of the T 6‚Äôs and a pair of the NC 9. The NC 9‚Äôs are by fair the better product and give excellent sound quality. The T6 are good for the money. They both have good battery life.

4,4 August 2023,United Kingdom,Really waterproof,5,"I went with them in the rain and it didn‚Äôt affect anything. Battery life is long, sound is great. I‚Äôm very happy."
5,29 May 2023,United Kingdom,Confused,3,"Audio is good for the price, and it's weird (in a good way) that I can forget I'm wearing them when I'm back from the gym and get in the shower without taking them off cause they're waterproof, but their biggest flaw is how sensitive these are. I got curly hair and sometimes just a curl bouncing on them will active them to press pause, or when adjusting them the volume goes completely down or all the way up. Really really hypersensitive and I didn't even remove the protective plastic film yet. Don't want to imagine how they will be when I do.Also really confused on how to open the charger port on the case? I've tried to slide it open, push it open, pull it open... Nothing happens??? I read the manual but no specifics on this, so I wonder if I won't be able to charge them once they die, or if I'll have to give up and waste money on a bluetooth charger which would be annoying!"
6,4 July 2023,United Kingdom,The best headphones!,5,These headphones are the best value for money! I bought my first pair about 2 years ago and they were still running until last week (when I lost them) and they still worked like new! I once dropped a headphone in freshly brewed coffee- it worked PERFECTLY fine after that!Easy to connect to phoneEar pieces don‚Äôt hurt your ear!I just bought my second pair- happily!
7,1 June 2023,United Kingdom,Pretty Good,4,"The sound quality isn't the best and there are other earbuds that offer better quality for the same price range, but they sit well and get the job done. I also like the colour selection and they're simple to set up and use."
8,7 July 2023,United Kingdom,Brilliant piece of kit!,5,"This is a brilliant piece of kit for the price. It is very comfortable to wear even for a long time. Being waterproof, it is very good to use for running and exercise. It has very good battery life. The sound quality is also very good. It is worth it for the price!"

13,7 July 2023,United Kingdom,Best earbuds ever!,5,"I've had these buds for 2 and a half years and they've never ever faltered. I recommend them to everyone who asks! You should definitely purchase these, 10000/10"
14,2 July 2023,United Kingdom,I did buy two of these and I‚Äôm on my second one but the second set is holding up well!,5,SO impressed with these earbuds compared to the price of airpods. One little touch and you can pause and unpause your music. Comfortable to wear and easy to clean with a damp cloth
15,29 April 2023,United Kingdom,Good in some cases....bad in some.,3,"I'll cut to the point, I've bought 3 of these before.The first pair, best thing since sliced bread, which were the black pair....then I got the other 2...one for me and as a gift for my partner (Rose gold and light blue)...the microphone quality and connection WILL dip and sometimes just straight up cut out, which is a real bummer, since the black pair worked fantastically.In short summary, for audio listening, pretty good, for calls and such, depending on your pair and the batch they come from...good luck.Overall, a 5 out of 10, due to the first being perfect and the other 2, being either passe or in the case of my blue pair, complete trash."
16,30 January 2023,United Kingdom,Great for the price,4,"fairly small and sleek case, the headphone hold a charge for a good while too. the wireless charging is a nice touch if not slightly slow (as is with all wireless charging). unlike wireless charging on a phone however, youre far more likely to leave these on a desk all day at work etc. so the wireless capeabilities make a bit more sense. comes with a handful of different sized tips so finding a fit should be okay.im no audiophile but the sound quality sounds pretty clear. especially for the price point"

18,20 March 2020,United Kingdom,Excellent wireless earbuds at a great price - and great customer service from TOZO,5,"My wired earphones which came with my Samsung phone are just about to give up the ghost so I looked around for some wireless ones because I was fed up with the cable getting snagged while I was doing weights, or by my jacket on my bike. These seemed to fit the bill. The reviews were mostly very positive and considering there are so many reviews, I thought I‚Äôd take the plunge. I‚Äôve only used the headphones once - on a 90 minute mountain bike ride on a trail today, and they are great so far! They didn‚Äôt dislodge at all, though there are several options to fit each size of ear canal.The packaging is very good and the instructions are clear enough. They paired immediately I took them out of the case and selected TOZO from the list of Bluetooth devices on my phone. If you want to then use them on your tablet, you just need to disconnect from the phone first.The sound is very good and clear, but I‚Äôm not much of an audiophile so this is all subjective. I didn‚Äôt want to spend a huge amount on "
19,14 June 2023,United Kingdom,Great Headphones,5,Great headphones and good price. Controls make sense and are easy to use. Unlike another pair I purchased previously. Good battery life & the charging case wireless charges on a charging pad. Sound great too for the money. No complaints at all.
20,5 September 2020,United Kingdom,"Good price, but somewhat frustrating",3,"Saying ""you get what you pay for"" in regards to these is both accurate, and a sign of the times. Five years ago, I paid about half as much for some wired earphones that were worse than the ones that had come with my phone. In comparison, given what you get, these are most definitely worth the price.However, there are some things to be aware of.Yes, again, for the price, they are rather quite good. They're (mostly) comfortable in the ear, the case is small, easily fitting into most pockets, and the sound quality is actually pretty decent. While I wouldn't want to rely on them for lengthy listening periods, they're good on the bus or the train, or on short-haul flights.Thanks to their water-resistant rating, they're also good if you want to listen to something in the shower, or in a steamy bath. I'm not entirely comfortable with the shower option, even after doing it several times, but if you want to, you certainly can. I am told by my family that they appreciate the lack of music blasti"
21,27 March 2023,United Kingdom,Great for te price,4,Great for the price. Sometimes can make it difficult for the caller to hear what you are saying.
22,4 September 2020,United Kingdom,"Excellent Bluetooth Earbuds, great features at a bargain price",5,"I was looking for a decent set of wireless earbuds and after spending quite a bit of time online looking at a variety of options and also following up on a work colleague's recommendation, I decided to order a set of TOZO T6's.Overall I'm very impressed with these earbuds, especially given their price of just 29.99 GBP at the time of purchase.The build quality of both the earbuds and charging case is very good, they don't feel flimsy or cheap, instead having a premium look / feel that belies their price.The charging case is compact and ergonomic (it fits nicely into the small 'watch pocket' on a pair of jeans), and allows the earbuds to be re-charged 'on the go' approximately 3 to 4 times before the charging case needs a top-up itself (there's 4 LED lights to indicate how much power it has left). It's also nice to see that the case supports Wireless charging for convenience, although it can also be charged using the supplied micro USB cable if you don't have a wireless charging pad to "
23,22 January 2022,United Kingdom,"Amazing quality, great quality, but slightly too loud",4,"I've had these earbuds for about a week now and I've been amazed by how well they've performed. I usually wear these while working or exercising and the sound quality in both cases has been great, not to mention that they're water resistant and easy to carry around. The battery life seems really good as well, plus the charging case helps me charge them on the go if I'm in a rush to get out of the house in the morning.My only criticism of them, and it is quite an odd one admittedly, is the volume control. While they deliver some stellar sound quality and the volume is fairly adjustable, the lowest volume setting on them was still pretty loud. I'm used to earbuds or headphones having the lowest audible volume being very faint, usually at the level of being able to hear a conversation while listening to your music still, but the lowest volume on these seems way too loud for a low volume. It also took me a while to figure out all of the touch controls for the earbuds, since I prefer tappin"
24,16 March 2023,United Kingdom,Simplicity,4,Easy to set up and easy to use. Good quality now bought another set for when gardening.
25,30 January 2023,United Kingdom,Not working as promised,2,"I‚Äôm not really sure if I got faulty ones or not, but it seems that these headphones lose charge despite me not using them.I had just fully charged them and double checked before I put them in my bag so they will be with me all the time whenever I left the house. However, I had had quite a busy schedule and didn‚Äôt really have time to just wear my earbuds so they were left for a couple of weeks. When I got them out to use them again (this was around a month or two after the original purchase, they were working fine for the initial beginning period of time til this moment) they weren‚Äôt even connecting to my phone.At first I thought this was because they were simply not working (which confused me since they were working fine when I first bought them) but I plugged them into charge and they started charging showing me that the case as well as the earphones were at 0% charge. This was quite annoying as I had just charged them, and before you question, they were fully secured in the case (eve"
26,20 May 2023,United Kingdom,Insane battery life,5,"I lost my Samsung buds, so was looking for a cheap alternative to replace them. I bought these over a year ago and no joke, I think I have charged them 4/5 times and I use them everyday. The only very small downside is that you don't get a notification etc when the battery is dying/ has died. Given that has barely happened I can't really complain"
27,1 February 2023,United Kingdom,Don‚Äôt work with windows 11,3,"I really like these headphones - I got some a couple of years ago and bought a pair for my partner. They work great on my phone (iPhone) as well as hers (Samsung) and also my laptop (runs windows 10). However they don‚Äôt work on her laptop (runs windows 11). I have found plenty of forums since with people having the same issues - no amount of trouble shooting has worked, and this issue appears to be 2 years old. Neither tozo nor Microsoft appear to be addressing the problem. They can connect and the touch controls appear to work (start/stop spotify songs) but the audio does not play in the headphones. It suggests an issue with the audio drivers.In all other respects, these are a great product, it‚Äôs just extremely frustrating that there is no warning about this incompatibility."
28,17 March 2020,United Kingdom,Initial review is very good!,4,"I've just received these today and on initial review they seem really good. Build quality seems very good, they pop right in to the case nicely. The case itself is nice and sleek, very small so fits into any pocket. It has a sturdy build quality and the matte finish stops you getting annoying fingerprints all over.The buds come with multiple sized tips, and they are much comfier than other branded ones i've tried. they fit snuggly and feel as though they are secured enough in the ear. I bought these for gym use, so keeping them in the right position is very important and shaking my head about, they don't move.They were easy to pair, there are simple instructions to do this in the package. The packaging is very good, they are shipped outside of the charging case so did require charging initially, but they're in a foam mold so very secure.The sound quality is really good, nice rich sound, deeper bass than my previous earbuds. I won't mention the brand but it was one that usually receives"
29,2 May 2022,United Kingdom,9 month review,4,"I bought these in August 2021 after growing increasingly frustrated with traditional earphones. So far they have lasted longer than any traditional pair I have owed, but with some downsides. They occasionally fail to reach 100% charge, especially now as they only make it to 90%. They become confused when I wear only one at work, often repeating ""primary"" or ""pairing"" randomly while in use even though the other is switched off and secure in the box. They do cancel external sound rather well, but adjusting the volume manually with either piece has been difficult; I can never adjust the volume one bar at a time, instead a single attempt either drops the volume very low or very high and deafening, so I'm constantly using the phone to adjust instead. Answering calls has been fine and no microphone issues to report. They also have a tendency to migrate out of my ears after a while forcing me to readjust...not sure what that is about, maybe I have weird ears. The sound quality is a major fact"
30,14 May 2020,United Kingdom,Excellent quality earphones. Although perhaps not the greatest for running.,4,"Ever since the release of Bluetooth earphones I have been an avid fan. Such devices, combined with a phone strap, have revolutionised my fitness as I often found that the old wire that got in the way was tedious. A year ago I purchased my first wireless Bluetooth earphones which lasted me a year because unfortunately the battery became unsustainable. Although they were a cheap pair for ¬£20 that I got from a market while in Spain. Anyway, I loved them and always wore them at university. They were basically a cheap version of Apple's air pods. While searching for a new pair I decided this time that I would fork out a little more cash and decided to purchase the Tozo's.So far so good, it's everything it promised in the description and came nicely packaged. You are provided with four sizes of earphone rubber, which is reassuring if you have small ears like me and they fit snuggly. The sound quality is perfect and is synced with whatever image you're watching on screen. To my pleasure, I ca"
31,30 October 2022,United Kingdom,Solid set of earbuds for a lower price,4,"Had these for a few years now, overall a great pair of in-ear headphones. The battery life is excellent and the sound quality, particularly the bass, is impressive.Despite being dropped a fair few times, the charging case charges well with that consideration.The same goes for the buds. After regular use for a few years, the sound quality is remarkable. Little to no noise or distortion in the sound quality. That said, I experience some volume and quality loss in one bud. Again could be due to the fact they've been dropped a few times, said, I experience some volume and quality loss"
32,8 December 2022,United Kingdom,Fantastic value for money,4,"After buying the cambridge audio buds that only the right bud worked, returned them and ordered a replacement of the same, these worked fo z couple of days, then just refused to charge at all, then ordered the oppo buds and again onlly one earbud worked so sent them back and bought the Tozo T6 earbuds and they are fantastic and both buds charged and the sound quality and design are very good especially for the cost.WISH I HAD BOUGHT THESE FIRST."
33,13 January 2021,United Kingdom,"Great, affordable pair of earbuds.",5,"Ordered these little gems after spending a bit of time reviewing an affordable set of earphones. Initially, I looked at a more expensive pair of JBL's, but I only really wanted these for walking the dog locally.So the verdict then? Well, in a word, Fantastic.The Good:Case- Nice weight to the case, but clearly designed to be portable.- Rubber, well fitting charging port cover. Nice touch.- 4 indication lights on the case to keep an eye on charge.- Magnetic case. This ensures that the lid closes nicely, and allows the buds to sit nicely within the case, and has a premium feel to it.Buds- Firstly, spoiled for choice when it comes to spare ear fittings, ranging from very small to extra large. I'd imagine that most people will find a comfortable fit. The default worked perfectly fine for me as it happens.- They sound perfectly fine for what I need. The bass isn't excessive, but there's clearly enough of it, without it sounding artificial.- There's very little sound leakage when they're in t"
34,18 November 2019,United Kingdom,Great sounding earphones with more versatility than the Apple AirPods,5,"Let‚Äôs face it, if anyone is looking to buy a pair of in ear wireless headphones then opting for the Apple AirPods is where almost all of us would start looking. But with so many other options now on the market is there something that is able to do the job (or even a better job) for a fraction of the cost....we‚Äôll, yes there is!The Tozo T6 headphones are a great option for anyone looking for their first delve into wireless headphone territory.Firstly the form factor is great, they don‚Äôt have the annoying stick down the side of the ear unlike Apple AirPods, these are confined to your actual ear, if you wear a scarf it means you won‚Äôt dislodge these, and with a true in ear seal, which is made even better with so many ear cup options they fit very snugly without being tight or uncomfortable. the case also mirrors the Apple style with magnets to hold them into place with a handy charge light on the case, the nicely clicking opening hinge further gives joy when opening the up, one minor grip"
35,18 August 2020,United Kingdom,great for the money but potential battery issues.,4,"If you are an audiophile then these probably arent for you but if you want a pair of decent budget earbuds then you cant go wrong with the Tozo T6. They have plenty of bass and the top end is very clear though sometimes a tiny bit scratchy at high volume. They are very VERY loud. They fit very securely, they come with 6 sets of rubbers to fit different size ears. They are simple to pair and use. Im not yet sure about battery life as ive only set them up and glossed over my playlists to test them on varying genres of music. The one down side ive found so far is there seems to be a charging issue. I gave them an initial, full charge after unboxing then left them till the next day. When i got up 3 white lights on the charging case were illuminated, dropping quickly to 2. I gave them another full charge and that seemed to sort the case out but when i paired them they only had a 70% charge. After trying them out ive put them back in the case and 4 lights lit up and are still lit an hour lat"
36,24 December 2020,United Kingdom,Seriously Premium Ear Buds WITHOUT The Premium Price Tag‚ÄºÔ∏è Highly Recommend‚ÄºÔ∏è,5,"I'd been looking at buying myself some ear buds /ear pods for a while now, as I own the Sony overear headphones which cost like over ¬£300 & are THE best headphones, however, when I sleep I cant lay on my back, & obviously its not possible to sleep on the side with headphones on, so this was my main reason for wanting some ear buds, however, like most technology these days, trying to select a pair, let alone the 'right pair' for yourself can seem daunting, & rather like a mine field, hence why its taken me so long to actually take the plunge & buy a pair.Firstly, I wasnt after apple ipods, or the galaxy pods. I wanted good sound, quality & volume level, with a good base, & good noise cancellation, - without a hefty price, bearing in mind that yes, I wanted decent ones, but not as my main pair, & I looked at several online & here on Amazon, before I selected these.Why did I go for these? They looked of good quality, they had good reviews, & I decided that if I wasn't happy with them when"
37,28 July 2023,United Kingdom,Useless for noise cancellation,2,Ordered these based on reviews but unfortunately they are useless for voice calls and voice notes which I do plenty of. Background noise was unbearable for callers (especially on trains and buses) but in quiet spaces it was okay.Held in my ear reasonably well with the smallest of ear buds- they are slightly too bulky for me but I‚Äôve seen ear buds ALOT worse.Overall I‚Äôm returning due to the noise cancellation issues and I‚Äôm going to try another version of this brand.

41,17 July 2021,United Kingdom,Good!,4,"I am really pleased with this purchase. I had been thinking of buying wireless earbuds for years... the wait was worth it. They work great, I tried them with the size they regularly come in and they were fine but sometimes I felt uncomfortable having the thing in my ear- but it is my thing, I've always been quite sensitive with ear stuff. I just changed them to a smaller size (that they provide) and they feel great, less bulky much more comfortable. The sound quality is quite good. When I'm walking around I only use one because I don't like feeling like I don't know what's going around me so the battery lasts for a ridiculously long amount of time. I can spend 2-3 days without charging them (of course if I don't have them on all the time and I don't use both at the time the whole day).The downside -but I think this happens with ALL the wireless buds- is that while you are on the phone or recording a voice note the noise from the surroundings is perceived very loud and sometimes your vo"
42,21 November 2019,United Kingdom,"Good value wireless earbuds, ideal for a backup pair",5,"I've used wireless earbuds for a while, and I'm generally a fan of my B&O E8 2.0s. However, I have been shopping around for a while for new earbuds to use as a backup for a few reasons:- The leather case on the B&Os feels premium, but it's not exactly practical for the gym- Connectivity on the B&O is not perfect when on the move, especially when your phone is close to your bodyBeing broadly satisfied with TOZO products (love their screen protectors for my Samsung Note 9), I decided to give these wireless earbuds a chance. They came promptly. The box has a real premium feel, and the earbuds are nicely packed inside, with the standard plastic protection you would expect from a premium product. Algotether, the presentation feels more Apple-y than I was expecting (which is a really good thing!).Taking the wrapper off of the case, it's very similar in size, shape & design to the Airpod case (which was the obvious inspiration). I was a little disappointed -- but not surprised -- to see a Mic"

44,5 July 2021,United Kingdom,Excellent ear buds and excellent customer service from Tozo,5,"I recently sent in a review , after one of my earbuds failed to have any sound, and after contacting Tozo via email, I was told I would they would send me a new set. Tozo followed through and my new earbuds have recently arrived, ( see picture). I was impressed with just one earbud working, but having two is totally amazing. Small enough to fit and stay in my tiny ears, as I have tried many different types of earbuds, and earphones and found they were either too large and uncomfortable or they kept falling out. The sound quality is brilliant. Noise reduction is great, my family thought I was ignoring them, so shows they block out other sounds perfectly. I mainly use mine for audiobooks and meditation apps and they are comfy enough to go to sleep in. Added bonus is they are waterproof and I have used them in the shower with no problem. No connection issues with my iphone 11 and I can leave my phone in the house and go in my back garden ( which is about 10 meters and not loose any signal"
45,4 June 2020,United Kingdom,Good overall reproduction. Awkward to remove bud from charger if you have big fingers. Good value.,4,"Decided to try these relatively cheap ones after reading one magazine review.Generally good. Arrived charged up so I was able to play with them straight out of the box.Small, neat storage/charger box, but this has the disadvantage that I find it awkward to remove the earbud from the box. The magnet is quite strong and the tapered design means you can't grip it easily with man sized fingers.The selection of ear inserts is generous. They do loosen off with use, so a slightly larger one to start may be best.As with many of this type, it's not good to press the bud into your ear with one finger, as this triggers the function button.The function button doesn't respond well to a quick tap, it needs a relatively long (but not hard) press to activate, with about a second between presses to go to the next function. It's easy to get used to though.Sound is a little ""thin"" but not bright or tinny. Not a huge amount of bass but fully acceptable to me.Volume is good.Connects quickly to the phone as"

47,8 December 2019,United Kingdom,Good value waterproof bluetooth earbuds with some nice features,5,"I have used a few different low-end and mid-range bluetooth earbuds so have something to compare these with. These are my impressions:Convenience - the charging case is very compact and comfortably shaped. For me. It is slim enough to keep in a jeans pocket full time without being uncomfortable. The IPX8 waterproofness is really handy if you want to use them in the shower or bath. I have tested the waterproofness of the earbuds by using them in the shower.Charging - the ability to charge the charging case wirelessly (using a Qi charging pad) is good to reduce the number of USB cables I need to carry, especially once I found I that could even charge the case wirelessly from my Samsung phone (though this will only work if your phone has Samsung's Wireless PowerShare support).Comfort in use - once I had found the best fitting silicone tips (which were a size smaller than the ones I tried first), these are as comfortable as any earbuds I have tried. They don't stick out too much and nor do"

50,22 February 2022,United Kingdom,"Easy to use, comfortable good value",4,"Saw these and ordered the black ones. Arrived on time the next day. Packaging small and well thought out found the ear plugs laid out on opening and the (station) case, with spare earplugs in a separate container underneath, the lead for charging. Came charged and ready to go. I put the ear plugs in their case and they automatically paired with themselves. Instructions were easy to follow. Paired with my iPhone 11 very quickly. Easy to control for volume, pause and changing tracks. These are easy to use I have small fingers but the plugs seem to sit nicely in the ear so if you have large fingers I can‚Äôt see them being an issue when using the functionality of each plug. Sound quality for the money is not bad nor is the noise cancelling. I‚Äôve only just got them so can‚Äôt comment on the length of charge or comfort of wearing buds for a long time periods. Very impressed."

It paired straight out of the box with my iPhone 8 and played beautifully from my iTunes records.Once I found the right rubber covers for my ears there was no problem. I do treadmill running and found no problem keeping them in. I watch catchup tv on my phone and the sound quality absorbed me into the programme and away from the strenuous regime... thanks Tozo!Price is great... I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt go for anything less and be disappointed ...again!!! Sweaty face or hands don‚Äôt affect the operation not performance - the buds stay put and my fingers don‚Äôt slip if I‚Äôm handing calls or reversing or forwarding tracks.

54,5 March 2020,United Kingdom,Great quality product at this price point,5,"The presentation of these ear buds is something that would leave Tim Cook sweaty and breathing heavily.They come nicely packaged with 3 additional sets of rubber insert thingies and a micro-USB cable in very smart packaging.They feel robust and of high quality. They don't have the cheap plastic feel of other headphones I've owned. The charging case is a convenient size and easy to open. It closes with a satisfying click, and the ear buds also slip into their magnetised housing nicely. Battery indicators on the outside of the case are welcome, as is the wireless charging capability for those of us too lazy to simple plug it in!Pairing is easy; I placed mine into the charging box, removed them again and they popped up on my phone.I tried a couple of different sized rubber thingies to find the right fit; I can shake my head aggressively (as one does) without the ear buds moving at all. They don't feel like they're going to fall out despite the lack of over-ear support but I don't foresee "
55,30 September 2022,United Kingdom,Fantastic value for money,5,"For the money, these headphones are the best purchase I've ever made. The sound quality is not going to be the best audio quality out there - but for the price, it's amazingly good. The touch controls can be a little tricky to get used to, but its still a nice feature to have. The passive noise cancellation is also surprisingly good.The headphones are easy to use and easy to pair. Whilst audiophiles may not appreciate the audio quality, I think most people will be perfectly happy with it - especially at this price point. The value for money is amazingThey charge wirelessly. There are a few different tip sizes to choose for the earbuds, and they've never fallen out of my ears.Most important is the customer service. I contacted the support team as I had an issue. They were incredibly helpful, replied very quickly and were very accommodating - most customer service teams seem to ignore you these days.Given the budget price of these headphones, I would (and have done) recommend these to an"

58,3 June 2022,United Kingdom,Correct fitting makes the difference,5,"I purchased these Tozo T6 earbuds in Jan 2022 and love them. They are comfy and sound great. There's a tendency with earbuds just to push them in and hope for the best and I started by doing just that, and found that they were uncomfortable and fell out easily. But after actually reading the instructions and playing for a few minutes, getting them oriented properly makes a massive difference.The trick is to orient the rubber earpiece and microphone hole to the front of your head and slide the bud in horizontally. A gentle push and it fits beautifully (well, on my head at least). If you look in a mirror and it looks like you've got a small ebony pyramid growing out of your ear, you've got them in wrong!A second tip is not to open your music app or youtube until you've got them in. All the handling can register as button presses before you're ready to go. Youtube annoying moves to the next unrelated video if you're not careful.In May the right earpiece stopped working. As it was past the"
59,14 February 2020,United Kingdom,"Love them, maybe too much",5,"I've not had them or used them long enough to talk about the battery life but I will update soon. Delivery was exceptional, I ordered shortly before midnight and the pods were in my hands by 13.30, approximately 14hrs delivery time, unbelievable.They come already charged to some degree but I decided to fully charge them before testing them. About an hour or so later the case had 4 lights lit, so all systems go. Instructions were very easy to read and understand, truth is, everything was automatic so instructions were almost redundant as far as getting started was concerned. I pull the pods out of the case...they came, I pulled out my phone and checked the Available Devices and Too T6 was already there, I clicked on T6 and accepted the device and they immediately started functioning as speakers.Sound quality is very good, I've paid more in the past and got less. I'm particularly fussy about both sound quality and available volume and these check in quite high on both. The sound has enou"
60,17 May 2020,United Kingdom,Great earbuds for fraction of price of Apple AirPods Pro,5,"I don't usually write reviews but I spent ages reading reviews about earbuds I thought I'd return the favour!The main things I was looking for when purchasing earbuds were comfortablity, fit (or selection of buds), sturdiness (would they fall out as soon as I start exercising) and battery life.Admittedly I haven't done a full hardcore run/exercise yet so will update this review when I do.Comfortablity and fit was a big hestitate for me ordering ear buds, and one of the reasons I hadn't purchased Apple Airpods, but I must say as you get a selection of 6 different pairs of buds you're more than likely to get an even better fit than apple (which is something they should advertise as I would have purchased them sooner!) Ironically enough the 6th choice of buds that came already on the headphones fit me perfectly so I haven't had to try any others yet but it's great to have the back-ups/options.Connectivity: Connecting to my phone took about 3 seconds, really it was that simple! Just took t"
61,20 April 2022,United Kingdom,Great budget earbuds,5,"I had been debating for some time about whether to invest in true wireless earbuds, but didn't want to spend Apple prices on a first pair.After looking around at the many different options available, I opted for the Tozo T6. My decision was based on reviews and price; at ¬£25 I figured that this wouldn't be a major financial loss if I didn't like or get on with them.The earbuds arrived earlier than expected, and first impressions was how smart the outer packaging was, and the charging case smart and compact. The earbuds them themselves were very quick and easy to connect to my iPhone and fitted securely in my ears and don't feel like they will fall out.For the price the sound quality is exceptionally good, clear vocals with a decent base and mid-tones, and easily compare with the wired branded earphones I own. There has been no loss of connection and they feel very comfortable when running, but there is a little background noise so I wouldn't say that they are completely noise cancellin"
62,3 December 2022,United Kingdom,Charging issues,3,"The earpieces are comfortable & no issues with the sound quality & would love these but the issue is with the charging cable that inserts into the charger box is poor. I bought the first pair 6 months ago after about 2 months the unit stopped charging cable stopped working. I complained and promptly received a complete set of new headphones, charging box & cable.Today the same thing has happened - initially the charger light comes on then cuts out - if you wriggle the cable it lights up, as soon as you release any pressure on the cable it cuts out. Think it's time to cut my losses & by a different brand."
63,5 May 2021,United Kingdom,Amazing but not good for phone calls and meetings!,4,"Love This headphones however read this review for more insight.Love the bass however that doesn‚Äôt mean the volume is on top level. I would say very good quality of headphones, however increasing the volume you just get more bass.Very easy to wear, very comfortable.If you want to train with it it is perfect.However if you are looking for the headphones to use for call, meeting, walk in the park and talk on the phone this are not the one for you. This headphones literally record the noise around you more than your voice. Whenever I was on the phone the other person would hear everything more then myself. Horrible, I even recorded my phone call, the noise is so loud it‚Äôs not possible to talk over the phone if it‚Äôs just a bit of windy since the speaker of the other person can lateral hurt their ears. Not sure why this is the case, how come you can‚Äôt control the noise in the back, but I would say that‚Äôs why the price is not that high.For your own use for listening to podcasts & music and to"
64,19 April 2020,United Kingdom,Convenience Vs not great implementation.,3,"I'm not really sure how to rate these. They offer the convenience of wireless but have issues that people need to know about.Sound quality:[UPDATE SEE BELOW]The sound quality is just passable. Many people will disagree on this and I understand why. The sound separation is not great, the bass is not forward enough and the mids aren't great either. Everyone sounds like they have the opposite of a lisp with the letter 's'. That letter is annoyingly prominent.The wired betron BS10 have better bass, mids and general sound separation.The ergonomics:They are not that easy to handle because you will inevitably press touch sensitive surface and activate something when adjusting them or taking them off to store.They are however the most comfortable earphones I've ever had. I don't even realise they are there and use them to reduce noise from the environment when i want quiet.In black, they do however look like two chunky scarabs in your ear. They are too big aestheticallyFunctionality:The touch "

66,14 April 2023,United Kingdom,Good ear buds,5,"Good sound quality overall with these T6 buds.Not tested the mic with calls, so unsure about the quality of that against any background noise or wind.The buds are easy to pair.Charged quickly, but it has a micro USB charger, not a USB C charger."
67,18 October 2022,United Kingdom,Great quality for the price,4,Gave these headphones 4 stars only because haven't had them for too long yet.Since the purchase used every day - and am very impressed with quality and battery life so far. Frankly much superior to my previous Apple wireless headphones.Volume control is a bit tricky but I don't really need it.Would definitely recommend!

70,11 February 2021,United Kingdom,Brilliant. Especially for bass lovers,5,"Excellent value for money. First thing you notice is the premium packaging. Intitial impression is that this is a quality product. The headphones are well secured in cut-out foam as is the charging case.It is essential to spend time trying the different eartips and achieving a comfortable snug seal. This helps the buds stay in place and achieves the sound clarity ‚Äì especially for the lower frequencies. For some reason Tozo have changed the eartips and they are now much softer.You can use them one at a time. The stereo audio is mixed down into mono.Phone calls are played through both buds.My initial thoughts were that these are a little too bass heavy for me but the more I use them the more I am liking them ‚Äì especially at this price point. The sound is clear and the stereo separation is fantastic.Tozo have implemented the controls really well. 1 tap to play, 2 taps to skip and hold to change volume.The charging case is nice and compact. I get about 19 hours playback including the charg"
71,4 February 2021,United Kingdom,Great Product even better Price.,5,"I wanted a bit of time to test these out properly before reviewing so 6 months later here goes. I wanted a good quality set of wireless waterproof earphones for running but didn‚Äôt want to pay the rip off cost of Apple Bose etc so I read some reviews and chose these and they definitely live up to expectation. Fast delivery and in good quality packaging, I purchased the black headphones, they look and feel great quality for the cost. Worked straight out of the box and has an 18month warranty sticker included, Sound quality is great - I like quite heavy music (Rock, metal etc) as well as some rap r&b drum & bass, so I tested a wide variety of music genres and also films and I am impressed with the quality in comparison to bigger brands used, the bass is just right and all sounds seem crisp and clear and the volume is more than sufficient unless you really want to wreck your eardrums! -Love the wireless charging feature and it‚Äôs so fast too, the headphones held a good 4+hrs continuous char"

I've not used them properly yet, but it'a neat package, and though the earbuds are a bit less comfortable than the Apple items I'm sure I'll get used to them.

Well look no further, these tick all the boxes!They look great and much more expensive than they are. The charging case is perfect and works well to keep them charged up and has LED lights on the front to indicate how much charge it has left. In terms of the headphone design, I was worried that they would fall out all the time, especially as I wanted to use them for running, but with all the different size ear pieces, I found a perfect fit and so far they haven't budged. It takes a little bit of getting used to if you haven't used similar in-ear headphones before but they fit well and are comfortable to wear for a prolonged amount of time. Just make sure to place them in and twist them for a secure fit. The sound is of a really good quality with a good bass and is good at cancelling background noise. The touch"

77,5 May 2020,United Kingdom,"Buy something else, seriously.",3,"Ok - So they seem ok at face value, quite bulky on the part that sticks out the ear, but for ¬£39.99 You can live with that.I use them for road riding (cycling) didn‚Äôt want to invest in an expensive pair because I was worried they might fall out at high speeds or with wind, they stayed solid for that which was good,However, when you put the hammer down and clench your jaw during a climb for example, the movement of my jaw caused the left one to fall out, 35 miles in so it wasn‚Äôt due to poor fit.Next 3 times were indoors on a turbo trainer and both of them fell out at separate times, once during light use.I use the smallest buds as my ear canals are small, I find them uncomfortable, a nightmare to seat correctly, and after a couple of hours on the bike I find I‚Äôve got a blister like sore on the inside of my ear where the bud sits.I‚Äôm aware this could be down to my ear and not the headphones but I‚Äôve had some ¬£150 let‚Äôs say Sneats by Dr Stay, and they were fine, no pain - they just died a"
78,1 May 2021,United Kingdom,Extremely impressed!,5,"There is no point in comparing them with Apple products or any other products, why, because they are brilliant and at this price ,especially with the 30% off , they are probably the best wireless earbuds you can buy (even better than more expensive ones). I bought them for my wife and she's hearing disabled (one ear 82% off and the other one 55% off) so you can imagine my thoughts about the earbuds, but after charging them and use them for about 1 hour she was in heaven with tears in her eyes, i can hear my songs sharp and clear( with the volume at maximum and some tweaks in the phone üßê) she said ,and i was relieved that my search finally ended üòÅ. Now her testimony: ""They are amazing i can finally hear my songs clear and the fact that they stay perfect and cover my whole ear it's brilliant, it's like a noise canceling thing, the songs are sharp and clear the bass a bit low (but that's good for her condition) and when I'm speaking on the phone i can hear clearly the other person, i love"

81,5 January 2023,United Kingdom,Fall out the ear too easily,3,I dont want to complain too much as they are cheap and you get what you pay for.My main issue with them are they fall out the ear to easily there is no way you could go for a jog or run with them.Other than that I'm happy with them as I own them but would not purchase them again due to what I said above
82,24 November 2019,United Kingdom,Highly recommended & quality premium headset,5,"I was looking to purchase Apple Airpods however could not justify the high end price for them which is crazy. After some research I decided to purchase the Tozo T6 due to great reviews but also I had a few Tozo accessories which were brillant quality.When the parcel arrived, quickly opened the packaging. WOW first impressions was really good. Everything inside the box had it's own compartment, unlike other branded headsets reviews I read which the headsets, charging cable, etc is just dumped in a box.The charging case feel really nice - smooth finish. It has weight which personally I like because its feels like you are holding something in your hand. The led lights are very visible & bright so you know the charge.The headsets look are brillant - they are much smaller then the images which is cool. Once you open the case, I went into iPhone bluetooth settings are paired straight away. Not hassle. Used then for 4.5 hours which is really good battery life.The quality of these headsets are"
83,8 December 2022,United Kingdom,Loved So Much I Bought A 2nd Pair,5,"These are the only earbuds I use.I was gifted a pink pair a few years ago and I use them all the time. The earbuds have held up over several holidays and international trips, days out in all weathers, hundreds of hours of use for all sorts of listening from music to live sports events. They are beyond comfy for me, something I struggle with as my ears as so small but the smallest included tips are an excellent fit (the 2nd smallest tips also fit me which is a rarity among earbud tips).Recently purchased a 2nd pair in green, gorgeous gorgeous colour and just as high quality as my pink pair."
84,17 July 2020,United Kingdom,Sound quality blew me away!,5,"Well all I can say is the hype is true, the packaging, build quality is all great.But the sound quality is definitely something I didn't expect. Just for the heck of it, I compared to my $150 Massdrop limited sale Sennheiser HD 58x that are open back and 150 ohms, so obviously way less portable friendly than the Tozo T6 and expensive. But the fact that I would even say the Tozo T6 is nearing competitive levels to the headphones is saying a lot. The only thing apparent is that its more bass heavy as with any other more standard headphones, but the clarity is definitely there and its not the case of muddy bass drowning out lyrics and treble. I'd say its 60-80% based on genres and how you EQ it, but again the fact that its even that close says a lot.Oh and of course I had to test out the waterproof-ness in a 20 minute shower. It surely survived with everything intact, although I learned quickly that my ears being wet makes them slippery and I can't even wear them. Also water does interfer"

88,25 January 2020,United Kingdom,Best Pair of Budget Headphones You Can Buy,5,"I have been a serious techie in the past and had a sweet tooth for all things cutting edge AV. As I matured, i learned to live without the latest gadget, favouring a more need based approach. Let's face it, a lot of technology is a nice to have, not a must have.I, like most people, saw the appeal and allure of the Apple Airpods. Apple have a way of marketing their products to create the appearance of quality. Therefore I was sceptical of finding a comparable earbuds for a reasonable price.Oh how I was surprised. I read these reviews and was hopeful I had picked a decent pair.I got lucky. These earphones are really top notch. The sound quality is stunning full stop and the fit would in no way come loose (I suspect even up to high intensity use) IF fitted with the correct rubber buds and inserted fully into the ear. Without going this and, as previous reviews state, you lose a lot of the quality these have to offer.I have found if using You Tube Music, to get the most out of these phones"
89,2 January 2021,United Kingdom,Very good value,4,"Overall these earbuds are very good value for what they cost.- For me the bass is a little too heavy (even as a fan of dance music) and the highs a little too tinny. But at a fraction of the price of mainstream earbuds such as AirPods (whose sound quality is nothing to write home about) these are a bargain.- sensitivity of the buds: I find that it‚Äôs hard to readjust these in your ear without accidentally pressing them and initiating ‚Äúnext‚Äù or ‚Äúprevious‚Äù track.- The packaging is very slick and ‚ÄúApple‚Äùesque. The buds and case similarly well made and nice to hold.- Charging is ultra fast but I haven‚Äôt used them heavily to tell how fast the battery runs out.- Haven‚Äôt done a full rigorous workout in these. Initially they didn‚Äôt feel as if they would stay put, but found that they did not dislodge despite doing a few jumping jacks with them.Overall if you‚Äôre not too fussy about having the top tier sound quality and want a pair of wireless earbuds whilst running errands/gaming, these are extre"
90,19 May 2021,United Kingdom,Clear sound; comfortable fit,4,"I bought these after my husband bought a pair (I let him be the guinea pig!) and although they're not a famous brand, they're perfect for me. They feel really comfortable even when I've been wearing them a long time (and I really like that they come with a few different buds to try and get the right fit). The bluetooth pairing worked immediately and I've had no issues with them communicating with either my Huawei phone or my iPad (although my husband had a couple of teething issues where the connection with his iPhone dropped, these just sorted themselves out after a couple of uses). The sound is crystal clear, whether I use one earbud or two. I haven't yet used them for a phone call, unfortunately, so I can't comment on this. The build of the case is a little plasticky-feeling, but it's strong enough and it charges the earbuds very quickly. I get a surprising amount of playback time when they're fully charged, too.Finally, it might not be relevant, but such a pretty colour!"
91,26 May 2020,United Kingdom,Great waterproof earbuds.,5,"Just in receipt of these, and must say for the price they have a quality feel about them. They connected with my Samsung phone without any problems.The sound is excellent. I watched an online review which said these aren't very loud and they preferred the T10's because they were louder. I don't know what this reviewers ears are like because I have it set on around a third of the volume and is plenty loud enough.The case is quality, magnets hold the buds in place and the buds lights turn red until charged. Only negative is that the buds are a little fiddle to remove due to the magnets and the buds having a shiny surface.The sound is very good. I'm not an audio freak so if they play my music and it sounds good to me, I'm happy, which they do.The touch controls are easy and responsive. Left or right, one press will play and pause. 2 presses left earbuds will play previous, 2 presses right earbuds will play next. Press and hold left is volume down, press and hold right is volume up.

93,4 August 2021,United Kingdom,Astonishingly good bass from such tiny buds!,5,"It's hard to believe these tiny buds can produce such bass sounds. In fact it's rather weird, because with full size speakers and woofers, you'd be feeling the pressure of the sounds in your chest, but all you experience with these are magnificent sounds in your head! If you don't believe me, try playing DERP by Bassjackers and MAKJ to experience just how deep the bass goes - incredible! - and at such a low price point too.I bought them to use in the hot tub as they're waterproof and because, being inserted well into the ear, they'd cancel out much of the noise of the tub - and they do - but now I won't be using anything else. Add the convenience of wireless charging, automatic pairing and the ability to use one bud at a time for mono listening, of Audio books for instance, while the other is charging and you need never run out of battery. Highly recommended!Update. I accidentally left these in their pod in a trouser pocket and they went through a complete hot wash and dry cycle. Feari"
94,25 August 2021,United Kingdom,Brilliant earphones,5,"Pros:- Nice packaging, a lot of different sized tips included.- Case is nicely sized, fits comfortably into even small pockets without protruding like a sore thumb.- Good and comfortable fit on the earphones.- Very good balance on sound quality. Enough bass to hear drops, but not overpowering. Clear high end without excessive boost.- Earphones drop into the case with a guaranteed connection and can be easily taken out. The hinge is very smooth, almost like a fidget toy.- Almost no latency, can watch Netflix without noticeable delay.- Battery life is good.- Controls are easy to operate, but won't engage accidentally when adjusting. The hold-to-change-volume is brilliant when running.- Pretty solid connection so far.- Loud output. Where I usually keep my phone volume around 60% with most headphones, I keep these at around 20% for the same volume.Cons:- Case charge LEDs can be difficult to make out in direct sunlight.- No indication on charging progress of earphones (except for a red LED "
95,18 June 2020,United Kingdom,"Overall a good purchase, with some reservations",4,"This is overall a good product, with fantastic audio quality and build. However I do have a few concerns:1. Taking out the earbuds out of the casing can be challenging. The top of the earbuds that one would use to hold and pull the earbuds out, is smooth and slippery, which makes it harder to grip. Ideally the top bit should have been angled or had some edges to make gripping easier.2. Batter life is not as great as promoted. It roughly lasts around 3 hours with continuous play.3. There are times if one of the earbud is used and the other earbud is at certain angle or location, the audio breaks. Probably due to some interference.Overall its a good product, however the pebble stone shape could be improved to have a better grip while holding or taking the earbuds out of the casing.The touch system on the earbuds is quite sensitive, which results in unintentional playback interruption. I would not say it is a fault, as the vendor would probably wanted to make a smoother touch experience, "
96,11 December 2019,United Kingdom,"Comfy with great sound, and cost effective",5,"I have been debating getting wireless in ear for a while now and as Tozo had an offering and my experience of their other products is brilliant, I gave them a go. So glad I did. The kit is neatly packaged and comes with 3 sizes of ear piece. I have left the ones installed in as they seem to fit best. I find this one of the biggest pros in purchasing these earbuds. We are not a one size fits all and the fruit based manufacturer of over priced ear buds would do well to remember this. Second decent pro for me is the shape and fit. Nothing hanging down outside of your ear, and a really comfortable fit. Third pro (price vs sound quality). At this price you expect the sound to be average, which it is not. Good bass and level on the high end too. I tried varying types of music to get a a decent sample size and it was great across all genres. At this price you can‚Äôt go wrong. Fourth pro, they are easy to operate. The instructions that come with the product are clear and easy to follow, but as "
97,23 November 2019,United Kingdom,"Great performance, nice stable fit and superb value!",5,"I really like these earbuds - I would sum them up as great performance, nice stable fit and superb value.I had ordered and returned over 10 different earbud models from other vendors (some cheaper, some more expensive) before I found these T6s from Tozo and am finally satisfied.! I have used these with my laptop and my mobile, I have used them for work phone & video calls and been out for two runs using them, during one of which I got caught in the rain.The sound quality is great, good base (but not too heavy which I like) and colleagues reported they could hear me well through the mic with no difference compared to my traditional wired headset. Key for me was the comfort and stability of the fit. The main reason I sent back the others I tried was that they either hurt my ears after a time or would fall out while I exercised ran, however I had neither of these problems with the Tozo T6s. I found the smallest of the 4 sets of earbuds provided the best fit for me, with 4 to choose from I"
98,1 May 2022,United Kingdom,These are amazing,5,"I have been using these for months and can say they are amazing. I was surprised by the sound quality, they are extremely good for the price. The durability of these EarPods have surprised me too as they have been used whilst exercising and were being used on a daily. The charge lasts for a long time for my usage and I can say it lasted longer than other larger branded EarPods that I have used. It comes with different ear cushions that you can choose from and I haven‚Äôt had these EarPods falling out of my ears either.The Bluetooth connectivity is practically instant and I had no issues setting this up. I also had no issue changing from one ear to the other or going from one EarPods to both. The Bluetooth automatically adjusts once you have set up the connectivity which is all but a click of a button on your device. It is well worth the buy and I‚Äôd be surprised if you were disappointed by these since these have been perfect."
99,1 July 2020,United Kingdom,Life-Changing!!,5,"I confirm from the outset that I have only had these earphones for a day but OH MY GOODNESS I cannot believe I have not been using them all of this time!I was fed up of the wires of my earphones been tugged by my toddler and getting tangled up in my clothes/arms/everything(!!!) when I was out and about. I decided to try wireless earphones. I was overwhelmed by how many were on the market. I needed reliable, waterproof earphones which also had a mic and looked good. After much research I came across the T6's. I was very cautious about buying them because they were not manufactured by one of the big well known brands and were not reviewed on the various tech websites out there. I could not however ignore the overwhelmingly positive feedback they had on Amazon. So far, I have found the reviews to be accurate. These T6's look fantastic. They are super easy to set up. The sound quality is excellent. They are easy to operate. The charging case is adorable and small enough to transport around"
