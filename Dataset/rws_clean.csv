Don't want to imagine how they will be when I do.Also really confused on how to open the charger port on the case? I've tried to slide it open, push it open, pull it open... Nothing happens???

They're (mostly) comfortable in the ear, the case is small, easily fitting into most pockets, and the sound quality is actually pretty decent. While I wouldn't want to rely on them for lengthy listening periods, they're good on the bus or the train, or on short-haul flights.Thanks to their water-resistant rating, they're also good if you want to listen to something in the shower, or in a steamy bath.

While they deliver some stellar sound quality and the volume is fairly adjustable, the lowest volume setting on them was still pretty loud. I'm used to earbuds or headphones having the lowest audible volume being very faint, usually at the level of being able to hear a conversation while listening to your music still, but the lowest volume on these seems way too loud for a low volume.

So far they have lasted longer than any traditional pair I have owed, but with some downsides. They occasionally fail to reach 100% charge, especially now as they only make it to 90%. They become confused when I wear only one at work, often repeating ""primary"" or ""pairing"" randomly while in use even though the other is switched off and secure in the box. They do cancel external sound rather well, but adjusting the volume manually with either piece has been difficult; I can never adjust the volume one bar at a time, instead a single attempt either drops the volume very low or very high and deafening, so I'm constantly using the phone to adjust instead. Answering calls has been fine and no microphone issues to report.

However, I have been shopping around for a while for new earbuds to use as a backup for a few reasons:- The leather case on the B&Os feels premium, but it's not exactly practical for the gym- Connectivity on the B&O is not perfect when on the move, especially when your phone is close to your bodyBeing broadly satisfied with TOZO products (love their screen protectors for my Samsung Note 9), I decided to give these wireless earbuds a chance. They came promptly. The box has a real premium feel, and the earbuds are nicely packed inside, with the standard plastic protection you would expect from a premium product. Algotether, the presentation feels more Apple-y than I was expecting (which is a really good thing!).Taking the wrapper off of the case, it's very similar in size, shape & design to the Airpod case (which was the obvious inspiration).

Tozo followed through and my new earbuds have recently arrived, ( see picture). I was impressed with just one earbud working, but having two is totally amazing. Small enough to fit and stay in my tiny ears, as I have tried many different types of earbuds, and earphones and found they were either too large and uncomfortable or they kept falling out. The sound quality is brilliant. Noise reduction is great, my family thought I was ignoring them, so shows they block out other sounds perfectly. I mainly use mine for audiobooks and meditation apps and they are comfy enough to go to sleep in. Added bonus is they are waterproof and I have used them in the shower with no problem.

Good value.,good overall reproduction awkward remove bud charger big fingers good value,"Decided to try these relatively cheap ones after reading one magazine review.Generally good. Arrived charged up so I was able to play with them straight out of the box.Small, neat storage/charger box, but this has the disadvantage that I find it awkward to remove the earbud from the box. The magnet is quite strong and the tapered design means you can't grip it easily with man sized fingers.The selection of ear inserts is generous. They do loosen off with use, so a slightly larger one to start may be best.As with many of this type, it's not good to press the bud into your ear with one finger, as this triggers the function button.The function button doesn't respond well to a quick tap, it needs a relatively long (but not hard) press to activate, with about a second between presses to go to the next function. It's easy to get used to though.Sound is a little ""thin"" but not bright or tinny.

58,Correct fitting makes the difference,correct fitting makes difference,"I purchased these Tozo T6 earbuds in Jan 2022 and love them. They are comfy and sound great. There's a tendency with earbuds just to push them in and hope for the best and I started by doing just that, and found that they were uncomfortable and fell out easily. But after actually reading the instructions and playing for a few minutes, getting them oriented properly makes a massive difference.The trick is to orient the rubber earpiece and microphone hole to the front of your head and slide the bud in horizontally. A gentle push and it fits beautifully (well, on my head at least). If you look in a mirror and it looks like you've got a small ebony pyramid growing out of your ear, you've got them in wrong!A second tip is not to open your music app or youtube until you've got them in. All the handling can register as button presses before you're ready to go. Youtube annoying moves to the next unrelated video if you're not careful.In May the right earpiece stopped working.

They are beyond comfy for me, something I struggle with as my ears as so small but the smallest included tips are an excellent fit (the 2nd smallest tips also fit me which is a rarity among earbud tips).Recently purchased a 2nd pair in green, gorgeous gorgeous colour and just as high quality as my pink pair.",earbuds usei gifted pink pair years ago use time earbuds held several holidays international trips days weathers hundreds hours use sorts listening music live sports events beyond comfy something struggle ears small smallest included tips excellent fit 2nd smallest tips also fit rarity among earbud tipsrecently purchased 2nd pair green gorgeous gorgeous colour high quality pink pair,5,Positive,2

Just for the heck of it, I compared to my $150 Massdrop limited sale Sennheiser HD 58x that are open back and 150 ohms, so obviously way less portable friendly than the Tozo T6 and expensive. But the fact that I would even say the Tozo T6 is nearing competitive levels to the headphones is saying a lot. The only thing apparent is that its more bass heavy as with any other more standard headphones, but the clarity is definitely there and its not the case of muddy bass drowning out lyrics and treble. I'd say its 60-80% based on genres and how you EQ it, but again the fact that its even that close says a lot.Oh and of course I had to test out the waterproof-ness in a 20 minute shower. It surely survived with everything intact, although I learned quickly that my ears being wet makes them slippery and I can't even wear them.

As I matured, i learned to live without the latest gadget, favouring a more need based approach.

Apple have a way of marketing their products to create the appearance of quality. Therefore I was sceptical of finding a comparable earbuds for a reasonable price.Oh how I was surprised. I read these reviews and was hopeful I had picked a decent pair.I got lucky. These earphones are really top notch. The sound quality is stunning full stop and the fit would in no way come loose (I suspect even up to high intensity use) IF fitted with the correct rubber buds and inserted fully into the ear.

They feel really comfortable even when I've been wearing them a long time (and I really like that they come with a few different buds to try and get the right fit). The bluetooth pairing worked immediately and I've had no issues with them communicating with either my Huawei phone or my iPad (although my husband had a couple of teething issues where the connection with his iPhone dropped, these just sorted themselves out after a couple of uses). The sound is crystal clear, whether I use one earbud or two. I haven't yet used them for a phone call, unfortunately, so I can't comment on this. The build of the case is a little plasticky-feeling, but it's strong enough and it charges the earbuds very quickly.

Only negative is that the buds are a little fiddle to remove due to the magnets and the buds having a shiny surface.The sound is very good.

If you don't believe me, try playing DERP by Bassjackers and MAKJ to experience just how deep the bass goes - incredible! - and at such a low price point too.I bought them to use in the hot tub as they're waterproof and because, being inserted well into the ear, they'd cancel out much of the noise of the tub - and they do - but now I won't be using anything else. Add the convenience of wireless charging, automatic pairing and the ability to use one bud at a time for mono listening, of Audio books for instance, while the other is charging and you need never run out of battery.

95,"Overall a good purchase, with some reservations",overall good purchase reservations,"This is overall a good product, with fantastic audio quality and build. However I do have a few concerns:1. Taking out the earbuds out of the casing can be challenging. The top of the earbuds that one would use to hold and pull the earbuds out, is smooth and slippery, which makes it harder to grip. Ideally the top bit should have been angled or had some edges to make gripping easier.2. Batter life is not as great as promoted. It roughly lasts around 3 hours with continuous play.3. There are times if one of the earbud is used and the other earbud is at certain angle or location, the audio breaks. Probably due to some interference.Overall its a good product, however the pebble stone shape could be improved to have a better grip while holding or taking the earbuds out of the casing.The touch system on the earbuds is quite sensitive, which results in unintentional playback interruption. I would not say it is a fault, as the vendor would probably wanted to make a smoother touch experience, ",overall good product fantastic audio quality build however concerns1 taking earbuds casing challenging top earbuds one would use hold pull earbuds smooth slippery makes harder grip ideally top bit angled edges make gripping easier2 batter life great promoted roughly lasts around three hours continuous play3 times one earbud used earbud certain angle location audio breaks probably due interferenceoverall good product however pebble stone shape could improved better grip holding taking earbuds casingthe touch system earbuds quite sensitive results unintentional playback interruption would say fault vendor would probably wanted make smoother touch experience,4,Positive,2

I find this one of the biggest pros in purchasing these earbuds. We are not a one size fits all and the fruit based manufacturer of over priced ear buds would do well to remember this. Second decent pro for me is the shape and fit. Nothing hanging down outside of your ear, and a really comfortable fit. Third pro (price vs sound quality). At this price you expect the sound to be average, which it is not. Good bass and level on the high end too. I tried varying types of music to get a a decent sample size and it was great across all genres. At this price you can‚Äôt go wrong. Fourth pro, they are easy to operate.
